If you are web dev, stop fooking use JQuery you donut, its 2023 we have VUE,REACT,SVETLE. <br>
Stop use 100+ css framework and 100000+ node libraries, pick tools wisely.<br>
Nowdays most of the devs are fooking clowns that using over million unnecessary packages and libs.<br>
Overloading their project with garbage.<br>
Where is engineers ??? Stop be just another developer emrace yourself.<br>


<b>ps: i knew my public github is not perfect i am changing and cleaning due being busy with a real job</b>.<br>

Funny quote : A junior developer writes spaghetti code, but an engineer embraces it as a delicious challenge. 😅
