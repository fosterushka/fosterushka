If you are web dev, stop fooking use JQuery you donut, its 2023 we have VUE,REACT,SVETLE.
Stop use 100+ css framework and 100000+ node libraries, pick tools wisely.
Nowdays most of the devs are fooking clowns that using over million unnecessary packages and libs.
Overloading their project with garbage.
Where is engineers ??? Stop be just another developer emrace yourself.
ps: i knew my public github is not perfect i am changing and cleaning due being busy with a real job.

Funny quote : A junior developer writes spaghetti code, but an engineer embraces it as a delicious challenge. 😅
